# platformer-game

This is the final project I completed for the Google-sponsored Computer Science Summer Institute (CSSI).
I worked on this project in a small group of three.

We utilized the p5.js library to create a two-dimensional platformer mini game, aiming for a game that
resembles a Mario game. In this game, the user uses the arrow keys to move left and right and the 
space bar to jump. Although the game may not be the best game ever, it is playable. We demonstrated our
understanding of utlilizing libraries, basic logic, and object-oriented programming to create this.

If you would like to setup and run this project, you can download the repository and open the
index.html file in a web browser. Note: this project is built using the p5.js library, so in order
to run the project on your machine you will need to also install a local server. Here is reference
article: https://github.com/processing/p5.js/wiki/Local-server. I installed Node.js and followed 
the instructions to run the program on my machine outside of the p5.js editor.

You can also use an online editor such as repl.it and import the files there. I originally used
repl.it to create this project.
